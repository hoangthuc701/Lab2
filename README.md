This report presents a comprehensive study on image classification using the CIFAR-100 dataset, focusing on the performance of various pre-trained deep learning models. Nine models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) baseline, were implemented, fine-tuned, and evaluated. The study investigates the impact of pre-training, data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning on model performance. Results are analyzed using metrics such as Top-1 accuracy, Top-5 accuracy, and F1-score, with visualizations of misclassified images and confusion matrices. The findings highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model, providing insights into their applicability for complex image classification tasks.
